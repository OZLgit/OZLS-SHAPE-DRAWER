This is a simple shape drawer using the turle import.
Porject is incomplete as I got lazy. Do as you want with it.
Reasonably easy to understand. You can use the following ;
The starter code required is :
from turtle import *
turtle = Turtle()
screen = Screen()

From there its free roam and make some shapes using code like ;
turtle.forward(90)
turtle.left(90)
turtle.right(90)
turtle.backward(90)
To make a circle use, turtle.circle(50)

"Pen" colour controlled by ;
turtle.pencolor(0, 0, 0)

"Pen" Width//How big it is, controlled by ;
turtle.width(0)
